# 📝 Simple-Diary — A Minimal Offline Diary App

**Simple-Diary** is a lightweight, private, and elegant digital notebook that runs entirely in your browser. It doesn't store your data on a server or database — everything is saved locally on your device, meaning **you own your thoughts**.

🧩 Build & Customize

Since it's all static code, customization is easy:

Edit the HTML pages to add sections or change structure.

Style it your way in the CSS files (style.css or main.css).

Enhance logic in the JS file if you want features like password lock, themes, or export options.


Once you're happy with your version, you can deploy it anywhere — Netlify, GitHub Pages, or just keep it as a local app on your machine.

❤️ Why It Matters

Simple-Diary respects your digital privacy and believes in keeping journaling personal.
No logins, no tracking, no cloud — just your mind, your words, and a space to think freely.
